# Welcome here =)

Here you can find all the resources I use to build my modules.
You will also find my modules, their Kicad files, their schematics as well as my sources of inspiration and pictures/videos of the prototypes and finished modules


You will also find

## [A big list of open-source/open-hardware builders](https://github.com/Pl0p/Modular_Synth/blob/main/Open-source_list.md)
All modules in the list are not necessarily in eurorack format, but all have their schematics available if not more

And 

### [A list (not yet finish) of modules by category](https://github.com/Pl0p/Modular_Synth/blob/main/List_by_function.md)
These are the schematics available in the list above but classified by category

Don't hesitate to participate if you find other sources of music/video schematics
